# ClearlyLicensedÂ "Weather"

The goal here is to select a set of popular projects and then compute their
license score on a regular basis. These scores eventually groupped by package
type can then be used as a basis to publish a licensing clarity "weather report"
and help track how license clarity evolves over time in this index of popular
projects.
